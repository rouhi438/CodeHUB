## Bank Card Design with Input Form

---

### Description

This project is a simple HTML and CSS layout that displays a bank card along with an input form to enter card details such as card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and CVV.

### Features

- A styled credit/debit card design using only HTML and CSS
- An adjacent form to input card details

### Note

Currently, this project does not include JavaScript functionality. That means:

- Filling out the form will not update the card in real time.
- There is no form validation or interactivity implemented yet.
